# MSB Studio - Generated NodeJS Client

This client was generated by MSB Studio, a simple WebIDE to facilitate the integration of your services by providing auto-generated client code for a quick-start.

You can find more information about the NodeJS client on Github: https://github.com/research-virtualfortknox/msb-client-websocket-nodejs

## Get started

Before running the generated client code for your service, there are some more steps:

### Install dependencies

(Required) Install required dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

### Update settings

Update the settings of your service in the ``application.properties`` file:
- Insert the __msb.url__ you want to connect to
- Update __UUID__ and __token__ of your service if neccessary

### Update code

(Optional) Replace the sample output of the function implementations with your own code in ``index.js``:
```js
// function implementations
```

(Optional) Add response events to the function implementations in ``index.js``:
```js
// TODO: Send response events for ...
```

(Optional) If you want to test your service sending data, update the send_data function in ``index.js``:
```js
// sample how to send events
function sendData () {

  // add your test events here
  /*
  myMsbClient.publish(
    'EVENT_ID', // event id
    "Hello World!", // event vlaue
    0, // event priority
    true // should the event be cached if the client is disconnected
  );
  */
}
```

### Test your service

Start the service:
```sh
npm start
```

Check the log outputs:
- Self-desription valid?
- Connected and registered successfully?

Verify your service in the MSB GUI.

## Next Steps

After testing the generated code, your are now ready to extend it and integrate it with your service code.

Add integration flows to connect your service to other services.
